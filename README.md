# Single Phase Subsurface Flow simulator

Based on Marc Hesse's course Modeling Flow and Transport in Porous Media

A lot of Matlab code already exists from when I did the course, I would like to port this into Python numpy functions. Mainly for practice and testing numpy's speed.

Could potentially extend this to C/C++ and OpenCL
