# Single Phase Subsurface Flow simulator

Based on Marc Hesse's course Modeling Flow and Transport in Porous Media

A lot of Matlab code already exists from when I did the course, I would like to port this into Python numpy functions. Mainly for practice and testing numpy's speed.

Some of the utility functions developed in the course can be utilized for a more general numerical library. Python libraries like Numba/Cython can compile numpy-based functions to C speed and greatly enhance the re-usability of these utility functions in other projects. An example of these utility functions is the numerical gradient of a 2D/3D scalar field.

Could potentially extend this to C/C++ and OpenCL
